***the string*** (2021) 

„Ä∞Ô∏è short film codirected by Jeongin Lee, Maaz Ahmed, and Kyle Adams in NYUAD's Communications Lab (IM-UH 1011) course „Ä∞Ô∏è

Project Description : 
- This is a premier website for the short film I made in class with my teammates. The film is a story of connection. Following the overall concept of the film, I used string images in the website to evoke the viewers' curiosity and imagination. The strings in the website are 'connection' between different web pages, guiding and stimulating users to explore the website.

Process :
- First, I created a wireframe for my website using Adobe Xd, applying the theme of connection and the string to the overall design.
- Then, I started by creating base layout of each page, mainly using css flexbox property.
- I also drew string images by html svg tags and added animation using javascript.

Reflection/Evaluation :
- I am pretty satisfied with the overall design concept and responsiveness of the website.
- Creating natural svg animation in javascript was the hardest part since it was my first time using javascript.
- For future improvement, I can work more on string animations to make it more dynamic and interesting.
