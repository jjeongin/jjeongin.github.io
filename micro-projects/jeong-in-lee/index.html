                        Benny the Fish is a kids story about a kid named Benjamin, whose dream was to get a fish. After writing a long letter to his parents asking for one, he finally gets his fish and names him Benny. With time, Benny gets bigger and bigger as the users interact with the comic to feed him. He gets so big that he is taken to the bathtub. After feeding Benny again in the bathtub, he realizes that he would need to let Benny go. With tears in his eyes, Benjamin lets Benny go to where he truly belongs: The ocean. But the story does not end there, as every year they meet each other again, and Benny takes his previous owner on a trip around the ocean. Truth is that Benny was never a fish, Benny has always been a whale!

                        Way Back Home is a website that puts user in the shoes of Bumble_Broken, an outdated robot that is lost and needs help going back home. Bumble_Broken may not have a working vision-camera, nor a beautifully recorded voice, but has a great memory. After the user hears the instructions, different recordings of landmarks on his way home will be played with binaural audio. It may be coming from the left or the right, and the user will have to carefully listen to where the audio seems to sound from and press the correct arrow key to make his way. The concept of our project is a website that can give the user a break from visual stimuli that the internet is already full of and shifting their focus to the auditory sensations, thereby also widening the accessibility for the users with blindness as well. We were striving to create an experience that can bring wonders to the users with the real-life-like experience of hearing when you are walking across a town.

                        Chroma is an interactive video that establishes a connection between identity and color. It is nonfiction and centers around three main characters, each representing a primary color. The white background and theme of the site and the video represent an empty canvas of society. Characters, and the user, add color to this canvas, painting the fabric of humanity.
